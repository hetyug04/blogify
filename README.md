##‚öôÔ∏èDevelopment
###	üíÖFront end
As a full stack development, alot of technologies went into the entire process, from start to finish. The first step was designing the platform, as I found from previous projects, alot of my time was wasted as I tried to design while I developed. For this I used **Figma**.

**Preliminary Designs for Desktop and Mobile Devices**:

Once I had the design planned out, the front end was pretty simple to flesh-out,. My entire application would be built off of ReactJS, for that I used **SASS** and the **Styled-Components** library to keep things neat and tidy. Once the front end reflected the design accurately, I started to work on the backend portion.

### üë®‚ÄçüíªBackend
Since I based my project off of the MERN stack, I used **MongoDB** as my main database, **ExpressJS** as a lightweight server-side framework, and **NodeJS** as a general JavaScript runtime to perform and test my application. Using the **Mongoose** library, I developed a custom User schema that would integrate easily with my **ExpressJS** functions. To pass the information back and forth, I used **ExpressJS** to develop a RESTful API that could properly handle the requests and responses needed to run my application.

**üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èServer**

    app.listen(port, () => {
      `Server is listening at Port : ${port}`;
    });
  } catch (error) {
    error;
  }
};

const router = express.Router()

import { register } from "../controllers/authController.js";

router.route('/register').post(register)

export default router

````
**üîíAuth Controller**
````
const register = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const { email, userName, password } = req.body;
    if (!email || !userName || !password) {
      throw new BadRequestError("Please Provide All Values");
    }
    const alreadyUser = await User.findOne({ email });
    if (alreadyUser) {
      throw new BadRequestError("Email Already Used");
    }
    const user = await User.create(req.body);
    res.json({
      user: {
        email: user.email,
        userName: user.userName,
        dateJoined: user.dateJoined,
        followers: user.followers,
        _id: user._id,
        __v: user.__v,
      },
    });
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
};
````
After the neccessary data is processed from the front-end to server-side, it would be preprocessed by the 
**User Schema**
````import mongoose from "mongoose";
import validator from "validator";
import bcrypt from "bcryptjs";

var today = new Date();
var dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, "0");
var mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, "0"); //January is 0!
var yyyy = today.getFullYear();

today = mm + "/" + dd + "/" + yyyy;

const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  userName: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, "Please Provide Name"],
    minlength: 3,
    maxlength: 20,
    trim: true,
    unique: true,
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, "Please Provide Email"],
    unique: true,
    validate: {
      validator: validator.isEmail,
      message: " Please Provide A Valid Email",
    },
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, "Please Provide Password"],
    unique: true,
    minlength: 4,
  },
  dateJoined: {
    type: String,
  },
  followers: {
    type: [String],
    default: [],
  },
});
UserSchema.pre("save", async function () {
  // (this.modifiedPaths())
  if (!this.isModified("password")) return;
  const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
  this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, salt);
  this.dateJoined = today;
  this.followers = 0;
});
UserSchema.methods.comparePassword = function (candidatePassword) {
  const isMatch = bcrypt.compare(candidatePassword, this.password);
  return isMatch;
};

export default mongoose.model("User", UserSchema);
````

Upon a new user registration, the information that the client has provided would be preprocessed by this schema, such as validating their registration email and encrypting their password using the **Validator** and **Bcrypt** libraries respectively. For some extra fun I also saved the date they joined the site as something to brag about later when this gets really popular

**User Schema Example**
<img src ="./readMeImgs/userSchema.PNG">

After the user information is saved, the server spits it back out as a response, then I can do what ever I want with it in the front end. Basically, the same process was repeated for Posts and the individual `User` themselves. With some JavaScript magic, I was able to handle very specific requests from the server. For instance, I had a helluva time tryning to figure out how I would retrieve `Posts` based on the users followings (Not to be confused with followers), so I whipped up something like this


**Getting Following Posts**
````
const getFollowingPost = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const { userName } = req.body;
    const allUsers = await User.find({ followers: { $in: [userName] } }).select('_id');
    const userIds = allUsers.map(user => user._id);
    const allPosts = await Post.find({ userId: { $in: userIds } });
    res.send(allPosts);
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
};
````
While it doesnt really look that complicated, it took a minute to figure out, even as a simple solution. You probably noticed that I used a `next` function in my `try/catch` statement, and that was intentional. As for the serverside, I used John-Smilga's custom error handler, that would be able to properly respond to specific errors and output them accordingly. Since I was able to specify the types of errors, it made debugging a lot easier. 
**Error Handler**
````
const errorHandlerMiddleware = (err, req, res, next) => {
  
  err;
  const defaultError = {
    statusCode: err.statusCode || 500,
    msg: err.message || "Something Went Wrong, Try Again Later",
  };
  if (err.name === "ValidationError") {
    defaultError.statusCode = 400;
    defaultError.msg = Object.values(err.errors)
      .map((item) => item.message)
      .join(", ");
  }
  if (err.code && err.code === 11000) {
    defaultError.statusCode = 400;
    defaultError.msg = `${Object.keys(err.keyValue)} is not unique`;
  }
  res.status(defaultError.statusCode).json({ msg: defaultError.msg });
};

export default errorHandlerMiddleware;
````

By the way alot of this I did after I hooked it up to the front end side of the application, I used **Proxy-Middle-Ware** to set up a client to server proxy, because for some reason a normal proxy in the `package.json` wasn't working. To handle the actual requests and responses, I used the **Axios** library to fetch data and display it on the front-end. This whole process, of getting user information, preprocessing it with **Mongoose**, uploading it to my **MongoDB** database and retriving it using **Axios** was repeated for (like I said before) for both `User` and `Post` handling. 

This `README.MD` is short explanation of how I set up my application, in both front end and backend, ill include a full list of stuff at the end if you're interested. Blogify is going to be hosted on Netlify, with the backend being hosted on Heroku.
